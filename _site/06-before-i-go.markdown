Before I go
-----------

That glorious moment passed quickly, too quickly even. Fear tried to fill it's place, but this wasn't the time to let that happen. I had to say goodbye to Oak Hollow. This urging feeling occupied my every thought. I knew that my wish was impossible, and yet hope tainted my heart. Father Pike, I needed his naive words now more than ever, about how would I become worth for anything. I hoped I would find something that engraves those thoughts in my mind, and then even I could believe them. Well, I found nothing of the sort.

As I was taking the narrow paths of Tinkler Mere nothing seemed to be changed. The little colorful birds were singing the same cheerful melodies. I chuckled silently at my silly mind. How easily did I let them elevate my shrank heart. I could almost feel the presence of Father Pike. It seemed utterly impossible that he was no more.

I left the well known paths. This time it wasn't me who lead my feet, my instincts were wandering around. My mind was empty, solely absorbing. Sometimes I found myself standing beside a young oak tree, I was touching gently the leaves and thin branches. I was not Flor, there was no hope for any communication. And yet it was unquestionable that we understood each other perfectly. I regretted not remembering the Mourners song. It felt only appropriate that I should commemorate my old friend the best possible way. If such a thing existed it couldn't be anything less, than that soft whispered-weeped song. But I guess, it wasn't my place to perform it.

When I reached the border of Oak Hollow I froze. This scene was unchanged as well. Only this time the permanence wasn't so welcomed. The forest was withered, lifeless. Brown, rasping, stifling dirt, as far as the eye could see. I slowly took off my shoes. I wanted to feel death under my feet, to plunge my toes into it. It was soft, consumingly soft. I was walking on my toes, I wanted to touch as little as was possible. For the first time I truly wished to fly. Finally, I reached my flat stone. The stream's water was filthy to an extent, that it became nauseous. Even so, I sat down.

All of a sudden I heard a familiar voice. A little girl was sitting near me. But she wasn't looking at me, she was talking to the river. No, to a tall man standing on the water. The memory was so vivid, that I almost fell into the water. I looked around and Oak Hollow was beautiful again. I was so very much relieved that a teardrop slided down on my cheek.

I turned back to the old man. I remembered now, at the beginning of our relationship he appeared in his human form. I almost forgot how old yet how powerful he looked. His hair and his beard were pure white, and there was no telling where did the first end or the second start. His smile was so kind, I couldn't imagine his face any other way. But what I missed most of all, was the sound of his voice. Deep and strong, it somewhat felt far away from me, as if I was listening to the voice of old ages.

'I don't like this story, Father Pike. It always makes me sad.' said the little girl.

My grandmother had showed me this place on my fifth birthday. It was the day I met the old spirit. Ten years had passed since, on that very day, Father Pike saw me crying and he would say that sorrow belongs to darkness. I was yet to understand the meaning of his words. One time, when I was about six years old I asked if that darkness was the night. I remembered clearly his answer.

'Why no, dear, you are quite mistaken. When the Sun sinks into nighttime the senses become sharp. The world falls silent thus one may listen to earth. In a way the gentle Moon shines brighter than the blinding Sun. But darkness, my child, brings a heavy veil to the senses taking away the feel of one's very existence.'

I could never imagine the last part. Apart that one ocassion, I liked his stories. A great deal of them was happy and adventurous, also they helped me forget my own story. But sitting there I remembered it very well. Twelve years ago a three years old little girl, who had never know her father and lost her mother, visited her grandmother only to stay there for the rest of her life.

The little girl disappeared, an older one took her place. Both of us were sitting in silence when an unnatural whirlwind brought the whispering voices. Even as a memory, it irritated me.

'Deirdre needs you home, I understand.' urged Father Pike the girl next to me.

'I told her I would be home by dinnertime.' said she 'Besides, what is the wind-mail for? Could you, please, tell her I want to stay a little longer?'

'It is your message, not mine. I shall not interfere. Either you go home or send an answer yourself.' was his answer.

'So be it! Then I'll just go!'

'As you choose, child. Be safe on your way.'

'Sure. I'll come back tomorrow.'

Then I realized I ran out of tomorrows.

What should I do next? I didn't want other memories to burst up, there was nothing further to stay for. Yet, I couldn't find the strength to leave. At this very moment, I noticed a silhouette between the woods, on the other bank of the river once named Silver Stream.

'Gwendal? Is that you?' I was absolutely positive about this. Yesterday I met his overprotective self.

No answer. The figure was standing there motionlessly.

Then suddenly it came to me, he left the evening before with Cathleen. There was no possible explanation for him to be here. Was I hallucinating? That seemed to be the perfect time to go home. Or rather, tt would be if curiosity didn't get the best of me. Somehow I felt determined to find out who was watching me. Even the water wasn't disgusting, a mere obstacle between me and my answer. I stepped in.

I didn't manage to lock out the feel of the lukewarm liquid. For I was sure it wasn't water. The strong little waves grabbed my feet, as if tiny hands were trying to pull me under. I made my first step, it was very hard to move. I pinned my eyes at the stranger's figure as I was moving ahead. Until the point I wasn't able to move at all. Then I panicked. I couldn't reach either bank, I was exactly in the middle, the stream was much bigger than I thought.

'Help! Help me! I can't move!' I cried out for the stranger. This might not be wise, but it was the only solution. It was all in vain, the silhouette was no longer there. I was laughing hysterically, it was a hallucination after all.

'May I ask what are you doing?' a voice from my left. My gaze met a pair of curious and cutting golden-honey eyes. The boy was standing on the bank I was headed to.

'Help me get out of here! I'm stuck!' there was no time for politeness.

'What were you thinking stepping into a dead river? Don't you know better? It will kill you as well.' His voice was scolding, but by no means was he worried about my well being.

'Will you help me or not?' I demanded.

'Let me see. What is there to be done...' He slowly walked closer, until we were facing each other. I could tell he was considering more things, I just hoped watching my death wasn't one of them. Oddly enough I wasn't scared anymore. His presence was calming. As I said before I'd never been a good judge regarding humans.

Then I realized how strange was his appearance. His hair was long, silver colored. He wore it in some form of a ponytail. Shorter locks covered his forehead and a part of his face. He seemed tall, then again, I was standing in a river. His build was undeniably strong. I couldn't keep my eyes off his lips. They were a tone darker than his skin, and perfectly shaped. He was slightly moving them as he was thinking. All this felt very familiar, despite the fact that I'd never seen him before.

His expression suddenly changed. He looked around him, then at me, then around again. I discovered some alert in his eyes, I couldn't explain. And another change, his face now turned emotionless. I saw his beautiful lips forming these words: It's too late. This I didn't believe. I was still alive, there had to be a way of getting out of there. Little did I know that an even greater danger was on its way to find me.
