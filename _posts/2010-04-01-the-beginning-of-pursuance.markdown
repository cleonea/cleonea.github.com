title: The beginning of pursuance
---

‘From the very beginning of time the enchanting secrets were inherited from mother to daughter. Long ago every woman possessed the skills that were maintaining the bond between humans and the Gods of Nature. They could talk with animals, and together with the Sylphs were giving heed to the balance between livings and gods, life and death. But the men had become jealous, and left the forests. After that, many women turned away from ancient arts and went along with men. Their punishment was to forget all their talents. Only one remained, the power of giving life. The Gods had become angry and cursed every women, even the faithful ones, so they suffer every time they bring a new life to the Earth, as the Sylphs suffered before dying when harmony turned into chaos.’

I had read this story as many times that I already knew it by heart, yet I kept reading because it startled and amazed me at the same time. And what’s more it had everything I liked in a story: little magical creatures, beautiful nature and most of all women and men, which lead to never ending daydreams about love, betrayal, and everything else that I could think of. Just, when right in front of my mind's eyes a pretty young woman lost her precious love, and was crying above her Sylphs’s dead body a sudden cry woke me up.

'You were supposed to watch the fire! What a useless girl! Get out of here!' yelled the old witch.

'And don't come back without a new oak branch! Alack, as a clumsy maid you are, you'll never become a real witch!'

Like you, I suppose.

I ran as fast as I could, away from my cruel mistress, thinking how on earth could an eternal flame burn out. As I reached the Ancient Oak Hollow I slowed my steps. So, Aiden, the dragonfly could catch up with me. Aiden was my only friend since I moved to my grandmother, Deirdre. That is why I liked magical creatures, I used to think that Aiden is my guardian and best friend, and once we will fight the evil together, whatever that evil would be.
I was walking slowly, as always; I liked wandering between Deirdre’s old cottage and the Oak Hollow. Narrow little paths crossed the bright, young forest. The trees were much smaller and paler of those near to Silver Stream. This part of the forest was full of tiny singing-birds, they were gold and orange, and their songs sounded like tinkling little bells. I named them Tinklers, and this part of the forest the Tinkler Mere, because it was the border of Oak Hollow, the most beautiful place I have ever seen.

The Ancient Oak Hollow was home of many crows, each one of them carries a walnut. The legend has it, that those walnuts were the very eyes of the ancient spirits watching humans jealously. That is why crows were dismissed, somewhere even hunted by men. This forgotten place took them in, and now they all stood on Father Pike's guard.

Father Pike was the spirit of Oak Hollow, living in a watercourse, named Silver Stream. It was flowing through the vale cutting it into two equal parts. There were huge primeval oak-trees all around covered by endless deep green moss. Among the tree giants white flowers were blooming. Beside the watercourse laid a shallow rock, which was the place where I used to sit when I was listening to Father Pike's tales. The watercourse, where the old spirit lived was narrow yet deep, and its water was so clean, that one could easily see through it, all the way to the bottom. It was also enough cold to give pleasure for viewers, but to give pain for those who’d like to touch the beauty. A refreshing smell extended, the water’s warble was calming.

'Why welcome, dear child! I haven't expected you this early of a morning! Come, come closer!' greeted me the old spirit.

'Good morning, Father Pike! It happened again! I am really starting to doubt that I'm a witch at all. Lighting an eternal flame should be truly the simplest thing, but mine always burns out. And now I need to find another branch.'

'Now, now my child! You should not question your power, that is why it is hiding from you. A true witch must feel the force and just then, become it. Your power only can be what you are. And when you will reveal what is inside, the ancient arts will come to you.'

'Thank you, Father Pike, for believing in me! But it doesn't help! I don't know where or how to look for the force.'

'You must not think with your head! Your heart will guide you. Remember your mother, and you shall find the way.'
'I'll try it, promise! But I have to go now; my grandmother is waiting for me. Good bye, Father Pike, I will come back tomorrow.'

On the way home I wished if only I could remember my mother. It’s cowardice, but I never had the courage to tell Father Pike, that I didn't have the slightest memory of her. It was too long ago, and I was too young, only three years old when she died. All I had was a silver necklace and her locket with a name on it: Aileana.

On the half way I realized, that I had forgotten the oak branch. It was getting late, so I turned back immediately thinking Father Pike wouldn't mind me returning. 

Suddenly a loud crunchy scream was to be heard from Oak Hollow's direction. Aiden went onwards to see what had happened, and I myself was running as fast as I could. The valley seemed the same, except the crows. As I arrived, they were about to leave not carrying a single walnut anymore.

I found Aiden at the flat stone I used to sit on. Father Pike no longer was there, and an uneasy silence surmounted to the Hollow rising from the watercourse. I had heard tales before about rivers that lost their spirits; my grandmother’s creepy bedtime stories were starting like that. A spirit never leaves its home unless the foe expels it with those poisons that strangle life.

I was standing at the place I has spent my childhood and was watching it perishing. The heavenly blue water turned into brown, the little sunbow Sylphs were not playing with sunbeams on billows. A grey dust-cloud appeared and covered the trees and flowers. It was harder to breath with every second, yet I was standing there tearfully. After the dust had covered everything, except me and Aiden, strange creatures were approaching from every direction: almost invisible human-like beings without faces, wearing brown cowls. They were giving forth soft whispers, it sounded as a sad pray performed weeping and singing. The willows on Silver Stream’s coast were shedding so many tears, as if it was raining. The shrouds opened their ever-closed dark eyes to see the Mourners mourning the Hollow’s death.

I thought I saw a silhouette in the shadow of a large mossy tree, it was gone before I knew it. I could barely see thorough the tear-veil I was fighting with. I wasn't even sure if it was an animal's or human's shape. I decided, grief was playing with my mind, I hallucinated. And yet, I needed someone to answer my questions.
‘What should I do now? What is all this, Aiden? What happened here? I see the Mourners everywhere, which can mean only one thing.’

‘Father Pike left Oak Hollow. I have seen such doom to happen but once.’ said the dragonfly. This little performance caused a temporal breakdown, followed by a smaller freaking out. This was the first time Aiden ever spoke to me.

‘You can talk? Why didn't you say so? I mean…oh, you know what I mean! How could you keep such a secret from me? Come on, let me hear the story! And better make it a good one too!’

‘I knew you would be angry with me.’

‘And it’s unreasonable why?’

‘No, it is not. I am a Mercury Demon, and I can’t speak to the protected one until it is in danger.  I should not even meet you till today. But since you moved to Deirdre I haven’t had the strength to be apart from you. Not after the pain I saw in your eyes. I thought my presence would help yet the ancient order would not been disobeyed.’

‘What order? And why I need to be protected? I can’t even…there is no source in me! At least you should know that.’

‘Oh, Sonya! Please, try to listen for a moment! I have never seen a young witch with such enormous power. Aileana was not just any sorceress, neither was Deirdre, your grandmother. And you are special as well, the youngest scion of Equilibrea’s bloodline. Equilibrea was one of the five Witches of Harmony, the youngest, the purest, the most powerful balance keeper ever born. You must be told now, Deirdre wanted to wait until you get older, but there is no more time to waste. We must go home; she will explain everything to you. I am not allowed to say anything further.’

‘But…I just…I don’t understand. Why are you here? Who had sent you? I’ve always dreamt of a friend like you, just never expected I already had one. And I hope you know that even if I’m confused right now, I’m happy that you are here and everything. But couldn't you at least tell me what had happened with Father Pike.’ Confused, lack of a better word really.

'As I told you, I have witnessed such a doom once in my hundreds of decades. The unfortunate spirit passed away, I fear Father Pike's fate doesn't differ from my old friend's.'

Deep inside I knew what am I going to hear, even so, I wanted him to say it out loud. Thus despite the incarnating grief I could part from him, the same way I left my mother behind. I had to convince myself that there was nothing to be done, except to suppress the pain, forget about it. I was always good in that. As we were reaching the little house Aiden told me how he had become my guardian.

‘You must know that Mercury Demons are incredibly rare creatures. Long ago, when humans and especially women lived in the forests, every one of them was bounded with a being called Sylph. The little ones could not follow those women who turned away from their duty and left the Old Forest, they were all doomed to pass away. When that occurred, could not bear the death of their siblings the Sylphs of Fives created a league and made an oath never to reveal the secret I am about to share. They brought the dead ones to life turning them into demons, and so the Mercury Demons were born. The Sylphs’ misery had made them forget that demons don’t know love and are tricky creatures. They were supposed to take care of humans’ new generations, yet from the beginning they were cruel to them. And so, just before the Nature Gods got to know about them the five Sylphs: Cleonea, Rhea, Melea, Laurea and Amalthea had taken the source of their magic: the flame of their burning heart scorched the demons. The sores were healed by willow tears and that is how the first and only magnanimous demons were created. Though the Sylphs didn’t survive the Demons became faithful guardians of the Fives’ bloodline. My mother was Laurea the fire Sylph; I am her last living son. Just after you were born, Aileana brought you to me. I knew she would not come if the foe would not be more powerful as ever before. Laurea was not Equilibrea’s Sylph, Amalthea the air-Sylph belonged to her, but her children were not warriors. They could teach you all the ancient arts, but cannot defend a baby. So, for the first time a Mercury Demon chose to protect an extraneous bloodline. Laurea’s sorceress was Doloure, she proved to be reckless and turned against the Fives, Laurea's children could't but follow their mistress. But her scions do not need protection any longer. For now, this is all I can share with you.’

‘That would make them the Fours.' The awkward silence made me realize this had to be the last joke of the kind. After a few seconds and "um"s I finally managed to bring together something smarter.

'Thank you Aiden, and forgive me my rudeness. I didn’t mean to hurt you. It was too much to handle. The Oak Hollow seemed to be dead, or something near to that. I can’t imagine what could happen there. And that noise we heard. It was just awful; I haven’t heard anything like that. I have so many questions to ask, my head is just full of them. I can’t wait for granny to answer them all.’
‘But you must be patient with Deirdre. It is hard for her to talk about this. She hasn’t only lost her daughter; her faith has gone with Aileana. She is overly tired, not a convenient guide for you, and she knows that. It will be the hardest thing to let go of another daughter, but she has no choice. Equilibrea’s blood flows in you, just as did in your mother. You remind Deirdre of her daughter painfully much.’

It passed noon when we reached the little house. The old witch waited for me and Aiden impatiently. When they arrived she barely noticed me, turned instead straight to Aiden suspecting what we had seen back in Oak Hollow.
‘I saw the crows leaving Father Pike’s valley. I have sent a message with the wind, but he didn’t send any answer to me. The trees observe silence, every plant subsided into silence. I was so worried about you two. What happened?’

‘Oh, granny, you wouldn’t believe! First we heard that noise, and then…’ I started.

‘Hush, child! I must talk to Aiden now. Go inside, there are chores that waiting for you.’ said Deirdre with anger in her voice.

‘No, I’m not doing chores. There are more important things to do.’ was my furious answer.

‘Don’t you talk back to me! As lumpish you are, housework is far enough for you. Now, go inside at once!’

Always the same quarrels, I felt so tired and spiritless around Deirdre. As if she slowly, imperceptibly was sucking life out of me. Finally I obeyed and started to wash up the cauldron, the vials and other dishes, thinking Aiden had to be mistaken. My grandmother by all odds will be glad that I'm vanishing at last. I made the dirty dishes wash themselves with a useful spell I had found in a recipe book, while I was daydreaming of thrilling adventures. I was the one who defeated the ugly beasts, yet the most beautiful girl ever born under the mighty Sun: long lank hair with the color of shining stars, eyes green as pale jade, a silver band on my forehead. Then suddenly my grandmother rushed in and crushed my thoughts. Aiden was following her, calmly perched on a window ledge and started to observe the precincts.
‘Come, my daughter’ said Deirdre softly ‘I must tell you about your mother.’
