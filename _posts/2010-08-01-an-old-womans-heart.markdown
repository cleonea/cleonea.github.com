title: An old woman's heart
---

It was a universally acknowledged truth that a beautiful woman without a husband is rather suspicious. But a beautiful husbandless woman with a child is beyond imagination.

Aileana was six years old when she moved with her mother to a little town in Canada. Mountville was a quiet, small village in the Eastern part of the country. People here were indifferent enough to even notice this minor change. The strange lady and her child rented an old cottage at the border of Mountville. The weather was so windy, that people only got out of their homes when it was absolutely necessary. It was a perfect place to raise an Air child.

As Aileana was growing older she became more and more rebellious. She had many friends, and spent a lot of time with them. Neither one was human. She played with the mischievous whirlwind, ran wildly through the windy fields with river-spirits, danced to the jaunty music of the raindrops.

 The quarrels between mother and daughter were sadly common. They didn’t seem to agree in a single matter. Thus they wrangled over chores, rules and keeping promises, Aileana’s friends and later even school. Deirdre couldn’t persuade her to start elementary. She had to hire a private teacher to teach the girl the basic knowledge of writing, reading and counting. Later she studied human history, philosophy, geography, biology and chemistry. In six years Aileana hadn’t find a single friend among the children of Mountville. This troubled Deirdre enormously, thus the subject was often brought up.

‘Why should I befriend humans? I’m not one of them, they won’t accept me. Can’t you see? They are odd and strange and mean.’ said Aileana one day.

‘Any the less you must learn to love them, to think of them as your siblings, because they are. And most of all you have to protect them.’ was Deirdre’s answer.

‘The people I’ve met don’t deserve any of this.’

‘They deserve chance!’

‘They had a chance!’ Aileana was well aware of the true history, as she would call the genesis of living creatures.

‘You can’t punish the boy for the father’s mistakes. Until you understand this, you don’t differ from them.’

‘Don’t say that! I’m different, I’m better. Can they fly like me? Can they walk and talk with spirits like me? Can they understand nature the way I do?’

Deirdre softened her voice.

‘Darling, you are a clever child. Thus you must know, these are not what matter.’

‘I hate you.’

Aileana ran out. Deirdre sat down. She used to talk to her mother's spirit, when she was distressed. Those days she had a lot to say.

‘Mother, I can’t do this anymore. I’m not like you, I don’t have enough patience. She is too difficult.’

Though arguments between them were part of their everyday life, neither of them had gone this far before. Aileana was running until she couldn’t breathe. Then she tossed down, into the high grass and started to cry loudly and hysterically. This was the day she met Aiden. He appeared in front of her in his human form.

The little girl filled with hatred and bitterness didn't notice that somebody was coming. When she looked up an amazingly beautiful man was standing in front of her. His sparkling hazel eyes flood warmth, his silky smile calmed Aileana's heart. Yet she was still suspicious of him, he was a stranger after all.

'My name is Aiden. I was crossing the vale, when I heard somebody weeping.'

'It wasn't me. You see? I'm not crying! Now, go away!'

'If you haven't been sharing tears, what is this?' He gently wiped off a drop from her startled face.

She recoiled.

'It's none of your concern! Go away!'

'Why are you so angry? I thought we could be friends.'

'We won't be!'

'Why would you say so?'

'Because! I hate people! And they don't like me either. And I have enough friends already. I don't need you. I don't need anyone!'

'As you wish! I shall take my leave. Farewell, Aileana!' he turned away.

She flinched. Aileana was absolute certain that he didn't ask her name. For a few seconds she tried to find a good explanation for this. After failing she tried to convince that it's the best if the stranger is gone for good.

'Wait!'

'Yes?' said Aiden without turning back.

'How come you know my name?'

He was gazing the ground for a moment without saying a word, then he went on.

‘I asked something!’ she demanded.

‘And I can choose not to answer, can’t I?’ was his calm response. But then he turned back. Aiden told Flor and me this story the night before we left the cottage. Before my parting from Deirdre, and I was truly glad for it. It wasn't just another memory of my mother. It also made me feel belong to this family. How utterly unlikely that the sense of connection should find me while leaving the only home I ever knew.

There were two things left to do, and I decided I would start with the one at hand. It was easy enough to find my grandmother. She was a woman of routine, and I knew her schedule by heart. As expected I found her among her flowers near to the cottage. Unnecessary kindness would make both of us feel out of place, so I tried to keep it simple.

'We are leaving today.' I couldn't think of a better start.

'I am aware.' She seemed to be preoccupied with the herbs. I could never read her emotions, then again I wasn't exactly a good judge of a character.

'I just wanted to say goodbye.' This didn't feel enough. I wanted so much more than a farewell, but of course I couldn't manage even this little.

'Well, you did. Will that be all?' As if we were talking about the next meal. There must be more to our relationship than cold serenity. I was just watching her while my eyes were slowly filling with tears. I could barely breath, my throat was aching as I tried to gulp my frustration. I was powerless, in fact, both of us were powerless. This time I wasn't willing to take the blame by myself. And then resistance took over my pain. I will show her how stubborn I can be.

'I will always belong here, belong to you. At the end every road will lead me home. The first step I'm leaving with will be the one that brings me back to you. I'll be on my way now, and what you must do is wait for me. Because when I return I'm showing you how an eternal flame is light.' After my little speech I found myself hugging my shivering grandmother. I was surprised to such an extent that, at first, I didn't even notice how off guard I caught Deirdre. I couldn't see her face, but could very well feel her tears race down on my nape. I gently pushed her away to take a look at her creased face. And I saw something in her eyes for the first time in our lives: anxiety.

'Don't worry grandma, everything will be all right. I won't be alone.' I decided I had to be the adult at this point. She looked at me for a long moment, sighed, and she was herself again. I've never thought it could happen, but this time her grumble cheered me up. Seeing her weak and human somehow made me insecure. Just like when a huge oak is cut down. I've seen people cutting trees many times. I knew it was necessary, but that didn't made it less sad.

At that moment I was ready. Come what may, I knew I was prepared for the worst. But before I drowned into horror once more I had to see something beautiful.
