title: Meetings and greetings
---

 When we got back Deirdre was leaving carrying an empty basket. She seemed to be off a longer time, which was weird, but I was too confused to give it much thought. Gwendal didn’t speak either, but the face he pulled was enough for Deirdre to answer cheerfully.

‘Dear my! Gwendal, why are you so surprised? A beautiful place like this can provide much more than privacy. Today it is not upon me to play the host.’

This was just the wake up call I needed. I went inside to put on some of the teas I almost liked. He came after me.
‘Are you nervous? You shouldn’t be. They are tolerable, once you get to know them.’

‘I suppose so.’ but I wasn’t really listening to him.
He must have realized it. We didn’t speak till the girls finally arrived coming from the forest, on foot. We met in front of the house. Florianne came straight to me and hugged me.

‘It’s so nice to finally meet you. I’m Florianne, but you can call me Flor. We’re going to be great friends.’

‘Florianne! Don’t be such a child!’ That was Cathleen. Her voice was cold and formal.

‘I am Cathleen Bayoumi, princess of Bast Su.’

Again astonished, though I had no idea where that place was. I couldn’t believe nobody dropped a syllable about this. Maybe Aiden didn’t want to make me feel uneasy. But what was Gwendal’s excuse? Cathleen’s beauty and grace intensified my fear. I couldn’t speak.

‘Don’t just stay there. You should at least introduce yourself. Why are you staring at us? What a disappointment.’

‘Cathy, cut it out! Don’t be rude with her!’ said Flor smiling, which was odd considering her words. One thing was for sure, these three had known each other for a long time.

‘Don’t call me like that! My name is Cathleen!’

‘Cathleen! You should apologize to her!’

I had a strong feeling of déjà vu. I shut my eyes to say:
‘I’m sorry. I guess I’m not that good at making friends. My name is Sonya Winters. And I’m glad to meet you. I’ve never seen a princess before, and I was overexcited to meet one.’

‘If only you had known it before she told you.’ said Gwendal coming out from the cottage ‘Do not praise her, she’s already spoiled enough. Where are Aiden and the others?’

How many of them are there?

‘Hawke! I understand you were quite in a hurry to arrive here before us. I wonder why. Besides, don’t you the smart one? Or did you stop spying on everyone? Don’t worry, they’ll be here soon.’ Flor suddenly took my hand.

‘Come, let us go inside. This could last for a while. Believe me, I know what I’m talking about, aren’t I? said she turning to the other two.

‘Shouldn’t we wait for Aiden here?’ I sighed.

‘Of course not. They’ll come after us. Besides, I’m a little hungry.’ I forced a smile on my face.

‘If that is the case, hurry up. We’ll see what can be done about that.’ We went inside, Cathleen and Jason stayed. 

They followed us inside after a little while. Florianne was eating the onion soup we had made the day before. She was the one, who broke the silence.

‘Sonya, do you want to know how we got here? It’s an awesome story, you’ll see.’

‘You seem to be proud of yourself’ said Cathleen ‘How careless of you. There won’t always be someone to save you. You rely too much on others.’

‘All right, all right. But it doesn’t make the story any worse.’

‘I really would like to hear it’ I said to end the quarrel.

‘Hurray! Then I’ll tell it! My father is a pilot, you know. And I’ve never had problems with height. Papa used to take me with him to check the animals in the National Park he works for. He brought me and Cathleen here, but I wanted to walk the last few hundred meters. So I jumped out, naturally without a parachute. Vixi can carry me, and Uvidia can carry Cathleen. They put us down and went to the place where we should have landed to meet Aiden, and they would come back together. They should be here any time now.’

‘Uvidia and Vixi? Who are they?’ My half-witted question.

‘Don’t you get anything? They are our Mercury Demons, of course.’

‘Cathleen, you spoilt child! You are free to go home at any time! You are not wanted here, unless you behave!’

The voice was coming from outside, soon the source arrived as well. It was Deirdre, who just came back with a full basket of flowers.

‘Do you understand me?’ she continued.

‘Perfectly.’ was Cathleen’s answer.

‘Grandmother! How did you come back so early?’ Changing subject.

‘I was just heading home, when I found an ibis bird, a dragonfly and a flying squirrel travelling together. Rather odd, isn't it? They brought me home.’

‘Is it so?’ I wondered. 

‘Aye! We did. She is not a weight for me.’ said Uvidia, a beautiful white ibis bird. Cathleen’s grace couldn’t be compared to this creature’s, but she wasn’t nearly as frightening as the princess.

‘Cathleen, have you brought disgrace to your mother by treating this child badly?’ asked the bird looking at her.
‘Don’t you blackmail me with Ebony! I certainly did not do anything wrong.’ I took Cathleen’s hand.

‘Exactly! Why would she do that? Cathleen and me are going to be great friends. You don’t have to worry.’

She won't fall for this. Such a lie, although I wished it true.

‘I see, very well. I trust Cathleen, you will forgive me.’

She did believe me, or so it seemed.

‘I shall. May I be exused?’ said the girl and rushed out.

‘I’ll take care of this.’ said Gwendal following her.

‘Will she be all right?’ was my question.

‘She always is. But aren’t you curious why I wanted to walk here?’

Flor probably wanted to cheer me up, so she took my hand and went out with me straight to the forest, in the exact opposite way I presumed the other two.

‘Cathleen is a good person, you’ll see. You just need to be patient with her.’

‘But how come Gwendal went after her? I thought they didn’t like each other.’

‘They quarrel a lot, but he always looked after her. I think because he can understand her the way you or I never will. They both have the same mother issues. My parents love me endlessly and they show it to me every day, I presume it’s the same with you and Deirdre. But their mothers are too proud to show affection, at least, that is what mother told me.’

‘And what about their fathers? Are they dead as mine?’

‘Nobody can tell. It’s really hard for humans to understand us. Either Ebony and Scarlet have been left or they left the fellows. You see father doesn’t know who I am. Mother tried to tell him once. She had said she wouldn’t stop him if he wanted to go. But then father embraced her, and told her if it would make him want to leave than he doesn’t want to hear it. So, all he knows is that I’m special in some way. You can guess how hard it was to hide my abilities.’

I was confused at this point.

‘Oh, you don’t know about the Earth baby. Um... Where to start? I know! Well, you know that each of us can control an element?’

‘Yes, I’ve figured out that much.’

‘The reason we can do so is because every one of us possesses a spirit of an element. You are the first one, the air. Then comes the water, the fire, the earth, and the life. That is the order how our ancestors received their spirits. Funny, that the first one, Equilibrea, was the youngest. And this is the order how the new generations’ powers appear, except that Earth babies have abilities from the beginning. Until I reach 15 I can create life and make it grow without any learning. I’m talking about herbs, of course. You see, for herbs earth means life, but Earth needs them as much. When I was little I used to make everything grow around me, and mother had to kill them before father noticed it.’

‘It must have been tough.’

‘Yeah, I think it was. I’m still not an easy child.’
We both started to laugh. We were walking around the cottage. Flor stopped at each flower and tree. She was touching them for a few seconds and then went on.

‘Why are you doing this?’ I asked.

‘Oh yes, this is why I wanted to walk the way to your grandmother’s house. By touching these herbs I get to know them. They are all talking to me, greeting me if you like. And I can help them if they need it.’

‘Wow! I can’t wait to have my air skills.’

‘You don’t have to wait any longer. Your training starts tomorrow.’

The voice came from above us, and a young woman jumped down from a tree. She was a lot like Gwendal: tall, skinny but not weak. Her hair was long and dark, but her skin wasn’t pale at all. A perfectly healthy color.

‘Are you Gwendal’s sister?’ I asked.

‘Smart girl, actually I am. You can call me Laura. Come back to Deirdre’s house, both of you. Aiden wants to say something to all of us, and I don’t want to waste any time waiting for you.’ She left us without any further explanation. While we were heading back Flor asked me if I knew that strange woman.

‘No... I haven’t seen her before.’ I stammered.

‘Than how come you knew that she was Gwendal’s sister?’

‘Well, it’s really not that hard to guess. They are so similar. Don’t you think?’

‘Hmm…Both are giving me the creeps, that is something for a start.’ and she was laughing again.

But I wasn’t. I was thinking about Gwendal’s request, it was certain that I had to be more careful if I wanted to keep their secret. When they arrived everyone was already there sitting at the table in the kitchen, even Gwendal and Cathleen. There were two more empty chairs for Flor and me. As we took them Aiden started to speak.

'My dear friends, I called everyone here to inform you about a sad event and its consequences. Yesterday an old friend passed away. Father Pike, the spirit of Silver Stream left the watercourse. It is absolutely certain, Sonya and I saw the Mourners. Oak Hollow is completely dead by now. Unfortunately neither Deirdre, nor I could find out who was responsible for this. The last time, when they found Florianne a note was left, as some of you already know. I haven't found anything of the sort now, which means it could be a random attack. But it is not likely.'

'Do you suspect that Arabella and Raven are behind this?' asked Laura.

'Not necessarily, they could have been some troublemakers. Nevertheless, there is a little chance, that they haven't seen Sonya. Her source can hardly be missed, even for those who can't sense such energy. I think the news already reached the twins. This means we must be on our way as soon as possible. That is why I chose Scarlet's mansion in New Zealand.'

'How are we going to get there? Where are we anyway?'

'We are in the Eastern part of Europe, Cathleen. The country is Romania.' was Uvidia's immediate answer 'Now, will you let Aiden finish his speech?'

The air was uneasy again. I couldn't stop thinking how lucky I was with Aiden. Though he was sometimes bothering, he never could possibly reach Uvidia neither in severeness nor in harshness. Nobody seemed to care to end the unpleasant situation. At one point I thought that I was the only one who was bothered by Uvidia's education. Even if that was so, I didn't want to learn to bear watching a friend being tormented.

'Madame' I turned to Uvidia 'Aiden doesn't mind questions, I'm sure of it. After all, questions' purpose is to keep up the conversation we're having about what we should do next. Don't you agree, Madame?'

I realized that the two of us suddenly became the center of attention. As if everybody was waiting Uvidia's next step. After a short pause she answered.

'I do.' said she 'But you shall address me Uvidia, as everyone in this room. Now let us hear what else Aiden have to share.'

'I don't have anything further to say. We should discuss how are we going to get to Scarlet.'

'I presume you already have a plan.' said Laura.

'As a matter of fact I do. I have been thinking it through many times, and came to a conclusion that we should split. Jason and Cathleen can transform easily, so they shall go together taking Clover, Berry, Uvidia and Vixi with them. While the rest of us: Laura, Florianne, Sonya and myself would take a regular human flight. Even the twins are not that reckless to use their power in front of humans, and when it comes to martial arts nobody can be compared to Laura.'

'I'm honored by your compliment,' said Laura 'but I think this plan is too risky.'

'It is, but I couldn't think of anything better. Let's hear your thoughts, Gwendal.'

'It could work. Though Cathleen and I have to be careful, and not just for our sake. It would be obvious that travelling alone like that, we are trying to cover something.'

'Exactly.' said Aiden 'We are leaving tomorrow. But I would suggest that you two go immediately.'

'We will go forward and send back a signal, then you are free to follow.' said Clover and Berry.

Everything was settled. I couldn't wait to start the journey I used to dream about. The only thing left was to say goodbye to my only living relative, Deirdre.
