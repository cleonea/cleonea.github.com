title: A story retold
---

Deirdre’s cottage was like an old magic hat, it definitely seemed to be less than it was. It laid beside the woods, in the middle of a vale named Milfoil Lap. Nearby was a small village, even so the vale was charming and charmed too, its inhabitant was far not. That is why the villagers used to shun the place. This proved to become quite useful nowadays. I had never seen that coming, after all I never preferred solitude. And still, since I've finished elementary school I was often alone.

The house itself was designed for one person to live in. It had two ordinary rooms and one that had a function of a kitchen, where Deirdre was brewing often, but usually meal had the least importance. The Milfoil Lap was full of virtuous herbs, and this made literally the saying that she had everything in the neighborhood.

Deirdre happened to be a famous brew maker; her teas and various unction were famous in magical circles. She had a lot of clients, but I never was allowed to meet any of them and never was told why.

The old witch had made some herbal tea, which was sour and bitter, only honey could make it drinkable. I had never seen my grandmother acting like on that afternoon. I felt as I had never taken a good look of her. Deirdre seemed really aged, her face was creased by time and her hands were shaking a little as she was putting the cups on the table. Then she sat down herself. Aiden must have observed the mixture of fear and worry about Father Pike on my face, no matter how calm I tried to appear. Presuming how I longed to hear about the beloved old spirit, he spoke.

‘I believe you are more than curious and worried about Father Pike than a word can express. Yet you must be patient to listen to a much longer story before, to have the better understanding of his. And since we are quite in a hurry – said he turning to grandma – I ask you Deirdre to tell her at once.’

I felt the vexation and impatience of these last words, but didn’t know how to react. Before I could figure it out my grandmother looked out the window and started to tell an old story, or at least she wished to start.

‘Aiden is right; the others will be here soon. You have to get through at least the first lesson before their arrival.’
She was smiling guardedly, but I could see, it wasn't a smile of joy. In her eyes I recognized sorrow.

‘I am sure you know all the books by heart, which you have been reading here. Especially the one with those tales about the old days. For all that I also presume you think those tales true since Aiden revealed his story. Well, if that is the case, you are quite right. And you see that is why the Fives have never loved. Thousands of years could pass by without any trouble in this matter, but your mother couldn’t act so, as she ought to, you know. How ungrateful child, I shall never forgive her!’
Deirdre was now so angry, so bitter, while a moment ago she seemed composed. I started to lose my patience as well. For a moment, the same fire burned in our eyes.
‘Well now, this was not going very well, was it? Since you are not much of a use at the moment, allow me to tell the rest.’ Deirdre shut her eyes, slightly nodded, so Aiden spoke again.

‘I have forgotten that you are not quite unfamiliar with the beginning of our history. Let us go through it once more to see if you can keep up. As you know, humans were just young enough, when all this occurred, to forget it – as far as I know – entirely. However, it wasn’t a scene that would make any of them proud, so the truth had become a happily forgotten issue, as it seems to be often. But though humans had just begun their journey, life was an old and respected matter on Earth. Every being was created and guided by the Gods of Nature. Akhem was the eldest, the mightiest, the Father of them all, and Amana was the Mother. They were honored by the spirits and livings as well. Akhem was free and playful, yet strong as the river, while Amana waiting for him in the Forest was taking care of mortal creatures, just as a warm hearted mother would do. They had many children. The males became the spirits of all kinds of water: lakes, rivers, seas; the female ones kept by Amana’s side became the spirits of trees. Mighty as they were, Akhem and Amana were not alone with such a power, for the Earth had four souls. Namtar and Tora were the second ancient couple – in every matter. They were not as dear as the first. Jealousy had made them hate the mortals, especially humans. As much pain they caused for Akhem and Amana, Namtar and Tora could never win. Life and death was in their power, but to win or lose against each other was not. Though one would think the very souls of Earth were immortal, they could get killed by another soul. They were together the Guardians of Balance: Akhem and Amana were meant to be the pure good, while Namtar and Tora the pure bad. Nowadays some of the people think Earth has one female soul, mostly in the western countries, but they are mistaken indeed. They fancy presuming Earth as a woman; I think it could be some sort of a memory of Amana. Humans just don’t understand that everything has a pair or another side. Nothing exists all by itself, even when the unknown part is hidden, you must remember this one Sonya, evil could not exist without good, and vice versa.’

‘All right, Aiden. I understand it. I’m not a simpleton you know. Besides, you’ve gotten pretty overzealous of the subject, don’t you think?’

‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to sound obsessed, but I have my reasons for being overzealous, as you said. Also it is really important for you to remember as much as possible. Tomorrow when the others will arrive at least your mind should be ready, talents can come later.’
‘Don’t be upset. I know, or at least I suppose – said I smiling – that you are not obsessed. I promise I’ll try my best. But for heaven’s sake, what is it with those so-called others again? Who is coming?’

‘Your teammates are arriving by morning, the other scions of the Fives: Florianne, Cathleen and Gwendal. They all know about you, and tomorrow you will meet them. Will this be enough information for now?’

‘I suppose. It’s weird though. How come they know me, and I have never heard of them? Strange, but all right. I guess it will be some meeting.’

‘Well then, I shall continue now. I’ve forgotten to mention that Namtar and Tora had children too. They were the spirits of wind and storm. As bitter as they were, for not being the first couple, they had a plan to trick Akhem and Amana and to put them out of the way. What I have never succeeded to understand is how they could forget that if Namtar would kill the first couple, that would be the end of their own existence as well, and Chaos would take over the Earth. It is interesting that people haven’t forgotten the Dark God, Chaos. But back to the point: Namtar’s and Tora’s purpose was to use Amana’s beloved humans to provoke a fight. I presume you know how this plan had worked out.’

‘I think I do. Men were jealous for not having any magic talents, and left Amana and the forests leaving women to choose between them and the Goddess. But I don’t understand why? I mean why then and not before? They should have been getting used to not being so much important.’

‘It is not that simple. For one thing, they were as much important or useless as women, they just hadn’t recognized it. They had talents, Akhem taught them, but it is all forgotten. I don’t think that anyone living possesses or knows anything about them. One thing is for sure, for men they seemed less valuable than what women were taught for by Amana. And thus they were easy target. Namtar had made them believe that creating is for weaklings, as Akhem himself is weak. If they joined him, he would give them the power of fire and weapons, so they would be stronger than Akhem. They could defeat him, and rule the Earth themselves. Such were Namtar’s words, and as hilarious an offer it was, the men had fallen for it. They left the Old Forest, taking women with them and joined Namtar, who kept his promises. Amana’s and Akhem’s heart was broken for humans, who did not know what they had chosen. Everything was working out quite well for Namtar. Akhem blinded by anger accepted the challenge. Their fight grew into war, and not just any kind. It lasted for so many years, that the parts were starting to forget the root cause. But not Amana, they say she was lost in sorrow for humans, while spirits and living creatures were fighting sometimes side by side, sometimes against each other. At last, after many deaths the war ended, by the most mortifying way. Namtar had managed to kill Akhem, but since one could not live without another, Namtar died with him. You can imagine the surprise and the pain what Tora felt. After so much time they finally won, and for prize she lost her only love. Tora wanted revenge, but didn’t know how to come to it, so she hid away. Nobody knows where she is now, but had promised she would return. Amana without any idea of the Fives went back to the Forest, and never was seen since then. The legend has it that trees know her hiding place. If it’s true, they have been keeping this secret very well.’

Aiden was focusing on his speech, so he missed to notice the tears in my eyes. My heart was aching for the four souls that much, I could not but weep. I was not sorry just for the first couple, but for the second as well, if not even more. For they were destined to fail, and live in pain. I was wandering if Akhem knew this, when accepted the challenge. Maybe fight was the only way to stop Namtar. But it is not likely, how could war be the only way.

I never quite understood what he said to me next.
‘It is hard to explain, but they are too noble, so much bigger to be pitied by a human creature. Our tradition strictly forbids it. Pity is a disrespect that can’t be shown to them, especially not by you.’

I had spent many hours thinking about what would be Aiden like, if he could speak. Either way, I definitely had not expected a bit annoying teacher-like voice to bumble in my ears.

‘But still’ I said changing the subject ‘I don’t see the bond between this sad story and the so-called Fives.’
‘This is every living creature's genesis, but apart from that I don’t think there is’ answered Aiden ‘except the war part. Because as I said before, nobody is sure if Amana is aware of existing such a thing, or if she is, does she…it is hard to confess, but I have to say, we are not sure if she cares anymore. All these thousands of years, we guardians were waiting for Tora’s return. And taught every generations various ways to defend themselves if the Second Great War should occur during their lifetime. I think today’s event was a proof of its coming, and not even the first one. The evidences are more than alarming.’

'Are you saying that I'm supposed to spend my whole life waiting for something that might never come?'

We didn’t notice that during their conversation Deirdre left the room. She had gone out to gather the afternoon herbs and now returned with a full basket of flowers.
‘We shall eat something’ said entering 'Sonya, put on the water. I’ll make onion soup.’ Irksome timing. Aiden didn't answer of course, but I decided I wouldn't let go of it.
While making dinner the subject turned easier. I had managed to be useful, and Deirdre mumbled as little that she was almost nice. During that Aiden was staying on the window ledge to watch over us. He didn't notice anything till after dinner. I was washing up the dishes, Deirdre had already gone to take a look at the herbs and the almost ready teas, when Aiden sensed something outside, but it was too dark. I run to the window, and saw a shadow for a moment.

‘If it wouldn't be most unlikely, I would say that I saw a big cat, a leopard or a panther.’

‘I agree, it was a big cat. But not one of those you’ve mentioned, it was smaller. I think it’s a lynx. And not just any kind, but where is he? Maybe he had sent them forward.’

‘Aiden, I can’t follow you. Do you know this animal? This lynx? And who is that you’re talking about?’

‘Oh, sorry. I think we have just seen Clover or Berry. They are the guardians of Gwendal, one of your teammates I’ve mentioned before. He must be here any time now. What’s the matter? Do you feel sick? Your face is paler than ever.’

What the...

‘I...I...Gwendal? A guy? I thought the others would be all girls. And why is he here already. He can't see me like this. My hair…my clothes…I’m a complete mess. And I don’t know half the story yet. No, that’s impossible.’
‘But I referred his name before, when you were asking about your mates.’

‘I guess I was so sure, that the others would be girls that I hadn’t really paid attention to their names. But still, why is he here yet?’

‘Aye, he came sooner than I thought he would. That means he must be exceedingly curious about you. This is not like him at all. Please, calm down. Gwendal is not coming to see your hair or your outfit. And besides…you will be just fine.’

Years later Aiden told me what had he meant to say that night. But back then it would seem rather odd if he would. He thought me beautiful. I just had to take his words, since our family tradition was to not make pictures. His words were about these: "A fifteen year old girl, yesterday you were just a child, and then, I saw but could not explain the change. I kept wandering when the playful foxy curls turned to mellow red waves. The pale face under the little freckles was not chubby and your nose was not snub anymore. The same jade green eyes were looking at me, when the boys were picking at you back in the elementary school, and now when you was going to meet one for the first time. The same despair looked for help and once again I could not do anything. The only difference was that you didn’t need it this time."

There was one other thing Aiden didn’t know how to come up with that night. Gwendal wasn’t curious to see just a girl, but to meet the team leader.
