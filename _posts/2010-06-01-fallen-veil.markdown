‘She is gone. Just as I thought, but it must have been Clover then. She is the scout.’ said Aiden.

‘So, it means that he’s yet far away from here, isn’t he?’

Before Aiden could answer a soft tap on the door was to be heard. The air froze in the room. I was terrified. I wished the one knocking would be the most petrifying enemy if that delayed the meeting with my mates, especially with this guy. I had had troubles with making friends since I was little. Simply could not fit in, partly because I had to keep my secret, and partly because I was afraid that they would deny me if they knew who or what I was. Deirdre also heard the knocks, and came back to the kitchen. She seemed to be absolutely positive that an acquaintance had arrived.

‘Come in, since you are here. It’s not likely for a Hawke to stay outside this long.’

The door was opening slowly, two lynx rushed in, and a tall boy followed them moving softly. At first he didn’t notice me, all of his attention was my grandmother’s.
‘Good evening Deirdre. You are not in a good mood, I see.’

But not the lynx made this mistake. They came straight to me, I was nearly frightened to death. I had forgotten for a moment that they were not real animals, but Mercury Demons. Then suddenly Gwendal turned to me, so I could take a better look at him. As he moved his head towards me, for a moment his dark hair hid his eyes. But I didn’t miss to notice that his skin was even paler than mine. His narrow and sickly wan lips were a little opened as he looked into my eyes. He was thin, yet obviously slick and natty, and his presence transmitted such strength. The sharp sight of the grey eyes reminded me of a wolf I’d met once. It felt he could see my very thoughts; all in all Gwendal seemed to be more frightful than the lynx.

He didn’t move, just stared at me. Though I was the first who came to senses, I didn’t know how to start. At last, Gwendal spoke.

‘Who is this girl? Is she a servant of yours? Where is Sonya?’

‘She is standing right in front of you.’ said Aiden ‘And now, since the first awkward moments had passed, I presume you should apologize to her.’

‘Oh, no. There is no need for that. Really, I mean, he can’t be blamed thinking me a maid, since I truly look like one.’ said I smiling, though it was a painful smile.

The way he gazed us I could tell, Aiden was surprised over my behavior, but words can’t describe what he felt for him who denied the idea of any apologies. Maybe our acquaintance shouldn’t start like this. Not that anything could be done about it, although my dear grandmother managed to make it worse. She was the one who broke the silence.

‘Well Gwendal, you proved that you are your mother’s son. A true Hawke, I shall congratulate to her when we meet again. Speaking of which, how is she doing? How is Scarlet?’

‘She is fine. Will you excuse me?’ was his short answer, thus he turned away and walked out. The lynx followed him, and so Gwendal was gone.

The following morning he had come into my bedroom, gently woke me up acting entirely different from the evening before.

‘Let’s have a walk together. It is so beautiful outside. I will wait for you in the kitchen.’

‘Umm…sure, I guess. I’ll be right there.’ was the sleepy answer.

I was astonished. After what had happened I thought he was angry with my, but at least disappointed. And so I wouldn’t be surprised if he was gone by the morning. Yet he wanted to speak with me, for I was absolutely positive that if he wanted to go sightseeing, he wouldn’t need my help. After all, he came here all by himself who knows whence or how. Finally I got up, but than a distressing fact came to my mind, namely all my clothes were the same plain, brown dresses. I didn’t have anything pretty to wear, except my mother’s necklace. Since there were no hope about this issue I dressed up quickly and went to the kitchen.

Gwendal was standing by the window to enjoy the beauties of an early summer dawn. As I appeared in the door he turned to me right away. I could see that his thoughts were interrupted, but acted as I didn’t notice anything.

‘Shall we take our leave?’ asked he smiling and talking softly.

I blushed and couldn’t extort a syllable. In a disgraceful silence I followed him outside. As we were walking it was him again who spoke.

‘You must be wandering where Aiden could be. Well, don’t be worried about him. He had gone to meet Florianne and Cathleen, to make sure they arrive in safe. He told me to look after you till he returns. I trust you don’t mind me waking you up so early. I wanted to talk to you before the rest of the team arrives, for there hardly will be another opportunity like this. But don’t be uneasy. Clover and Berry are near by, they will let me know if we should turn back.’

Therewith he silenced looking at me. I was confused and furious.

‘I do not need anybody to look after me. I’m not that helpless, nor am I a damsel in distress or something. You are speaking just as mysteriously as Aiden does. I don’t understand this sudden change. Yesterday I was a servant, and today everyone wants to save my life. But nobody explains a thing. For Heaven’s sake, will someone tell me what is going on? Even if I am a weakling of no use, even if I can’t help, I want at least to know what’s happening around me!’

Listening to me the smile and the kindness disappeared, his face was now serious. I recognized his sharp look. It was the same as the evening before. For an instant I thought, I saw a silhouette of an animal’s spirit.

‘Please, forgive me if I had hurt you. It was unconsciously done. I understand your anger, and I agree with you. You must learn the truth. And I do own the power to ease your curiosity if that is what you truly want.’

This speech calmed my rage. At first I hesitated, for there must be some unpleasant things to be heard, since everyone who I knew found it hard to speak about it. But I had to learn them, no matter how sullen the issues were.
‘Yes, there's nothing I would like more.’ was therefore the answer.

‘So let it be, if that is the case, I shall fulfill your wish. But first I must tell you the purpose of this walk. Soon my sister arrives, and we will go to my mother’s mansion in New Zealand, where we are to be trained. Florianne is young, she has to learn a lot. Cathleen has been preparing all her life, and so have I. But you, who shall find wisdom to guide us, are yet to find the source within. I must say I would not obey you if I hadn’t been born to do so. During your staying at my mother’s home you will be taught many arts. And I’ve decided to teach you, together with Laura, the hardest of them: we shall show you the way how to become a fair leader, though the steps can only be made by you. But neither of us can insist on you, that is why we are here: for me to ask if you would accept our help. But before you make up your mind, there is one thing you must promise, never to tell anyone, not even Aiden that I offered such a support.’

‘Let us pretend that you haven’t said I have to lead all of you or something near to that. And also let us pretend that I’m not panicking. God, I’m so bad at acting.’

‘You mean to say you didn’t know it. This changes everything.’

‘What? Is there something else, some other little detail that everybody had forgotten to mention?’

‘No, no. Please, I beg you, don’t be afraid. Everything will be all right, you’ll see.’

‘Oh, yes. Definitely. We’ll be just fine, once I get to order you around. This must be a mistake. Are you sure? Are you absolutely positive that you are talking to the right person? And how do you want to help me? Which is by the by very nice of you. But don’t waste your time on me, I’m such a good-for-nothing. Believe me, I can show you a whole new dimension of clumsiness.’

‘Aye! You are the one, it is certain. I would be sure of it by now even if I didn’t know from the start. The source in you is so powerful. I can hardly sense anything else when you are this close to me.’

‘No! Stop saying that! It's not true! It can’t be! There is nothing, do you hear me? Nothing at all! Or else I would have found it already! I’m fifteen, it’s too late! If mother was here she would be ashamed of me, and so am I.’ as I was talking my eyes started to flow. Despair painted my face red, I wanted to run away from him, from those I was yet to meet and from the disappointed looks of the loved ones. He looked in my eyes, teased by sorrow. My tears were falling, but never reaching the ground. The wind was blowing around us stronger and stronger, to whoosh and to whizz like a smashing pain of a screaming child. Gwendal needed some time to realize, that I almost brought a hurricane into being, unconsciously. He caught my left hand, pressed me stoutly to his breast, and whispered into my ears.

‘Don’t be afraid. When I’m by your side demons can’t reach you.’

All of a sudden the wind stopped, and I looked at him.

‘What did you just say? I think I'd heard it before.’

‘You must have. This was what your mother said to me, when we met once.’

We realized that he was still holding me. I blushed, and he let go of me. I couldn’t look into his eyes, and sat down by a willow to hide my shame.

‘So that means you knew my mother.’

‘In some way, I did. But I saw her just that one time, and I was only four years old. She had come to visit my mother. I don’t know what her purpose was. She stayed only for one night, I remember clearly. You see, I always had a hard time to get along with my precious mother, and that day we had had a great deal of fight. Late at night I sneaked out to run away. It was a pretty stupid idea, but I guess I was too young to realize that. Anyway, I didn’t get too far when I got scared. I was all alone in the woods, and it was so dark. My whole body was shaking. I sat down and started to cry. Then I heard that somebody was coming, I was terrified at first, but I beheld her. She wore a white dress or something bright and her face was so beautiful, I thought I saw an angel. She had come to me, sat on her heels and hugged me saying the very words I did now. Then she took me home, and promised to keep my secret. The next morning she was gone. Aileana was truly amazing. I have never seen such noble charm.’

‘Yes, she was. What you were saying, it is so like her. She was always nice to me too.’

I was lying, but I felt it must be like this. I was too afraid what would everybody think if they knew I couldn’t remember my own mother. And not just any kind of mother, but as it appeared the best of them all. While I was speaking Gwendal looked surprised, but he continued to smile.

‘I could say that, but since you’ve mentioned, it must have been so.’

He sat by my side to continue the subject we talked about before he met my source in person.

‘Back to an old point, you haven’t answered to my question yet.’

‘Oh, yes. I suppose I was overreacting, ha? I’m sorry for that. You know, the crying and all. I didn’t mean to cause you any trouble.’

‘Never mind. Though we have some skills or other, we are still humans. Sometimes we can be weak, that’s nothing to be ashamed of. I’ve always thought that being afraid means that you are alive, and while it is so chances will come to act brave. It doesn’t make you coward, I mean fear. The source of it can be the source of a strength never known. Like when you have something or somebody you love, it can make you worried, frightens you, but also it gives the power to carry on, to protect those, the loved ones. Don’t you think so?’

‘Well, if you put it that way. I guess I would like it to be so, as you said, about everything. About the other thing I’m not quite sure just yet. But don’t worry I’ll keep your secret, like my mom did. Not that there is so many I could tell.’

As I was talking his face turned easy once again. I had to admit, Gwendal was really handsome, especially when he was smiling. His cold beauty then turned to something gentle and peaceful.

 ‘There is this one thing I wanted you to ask.’ I started ‘Exactly, what are your powers?’

He looked surprised, my question left him speechless for a few seconds.

‘You mean my talents related to the supernatural, I suppose.’ said he chuckling.

‘Yes. What’s so funny?’

‘Nothing, forgive me, please. The thing is that it’s a bit more complicated to name it as some power. We are not superheroes, you know. And the way you were asking, for me it sounded like you were talking about some comic book characters. But never mind me. Back to your question: let us say that I have something in common with animals, but the human mind is my specialty.’

‘That means you are able to read my mind?’ came to me instantly.

‘Again, it’s more complex to say I do or I do not. Hard to explain, and even harder to imagine, but I can sense people’s intentions. They all have some peculiar smells, like flowers. For me every human is a bouquet, though some of them are quite smelly, the cruel souls of course. And also I can see their thoughts, but not as motion pictures. More like a mixture of lights and colors. There is one more gift I own, I hear the fear of every scion of the Fives. That means if you are in trouble, I can always find you.’ I blushed at the last one.

‘Huh, these are some talents. To be honest, I am not sure about mines. But I think you forgot one thing. There was something about you telling me the goings-on in an unusual way.’

‘Oh, yes. But I truly can’t describe that. Let me show you this one!’

He quickly got up and sat on his heels in front of me. He reached out for my forehead with his right hand, only the fingertips were touching slightly my skin, and yet I felt a great pain coming from that point, it lasted for an instant, when a sudden impulse pushed my back to the tree intently. Thus my backbone ached, but this suffer couldn’t be compared to that in my heart. I saw it, I knew it, even more than I had wanted to. I saw the past that I used to read about from the inside, as I was the part of it. The ancient secret, which eats up its cognizant from now on, was my mate as well. At first I was terrified and disgusted. But slowly, it turned into a bitter yet warm sadness. I saw my mother, and could now remember her face and her voice, though the ugly truth made the remembrance hard.

‘We should go back to your house. We don’t want the guests to wait for the host, do we?’ said Gwendal, maybe he had the feeling that I would rather not talk just yet. He seemed surprised by my silence, but didn't mention anything. I nodded, staring at the ground stood up and we went back to the cottage.
